This is a getting started project to test some of the mostly used features in "AutoMapper"

**_As mentioned in [here](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2016/01/21/removing-the-static-api-from-automapper/) and in [here](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper/wiki/Static-and-Instance-API) 
the preferred way to use AutoMapper is to use the instance API and to avoid using the static API._**
